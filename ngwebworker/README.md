# Ngwebworker
# Extract webpack file
Run 
```dos ng eject``` 
so Angular CLI generates the webpack.config.js file.

Run 
```dos npm install``` 
so the new dependencies generated by CLI are satisfied.

# Install webworker bootstrap dependencies
Run 
```dos npm install --save @angular/platform-webworker @angular/platform-webworker-dynamic```

# Changes in UI thread bootstrap

Changes in app.module.ts
Replace BrowserModule by WorkerAppModule in the app.module.ts file. You’ll also need to update the import statement in order to use @angular/platform-webworker library.

# Changes in src/main.ts

Replace bootstrap process with: bootstrapWorkerUI (update also the import).
You’ll need to pass a URL with the file where the web worker is defined. Use a file called webworker.bundle.js, don’t worry, we will create this file soon.

# Create workerLoader.ts file
Create a new file src/workerLoader.ts

As your Web Worker will be a single file containing all the required stuff, you need to include polyfills.ts, @angular/core, and @angular/common packages. On next steps, you will update Webpack in order to transpile and build a bundle with the result.

Import platformWorkerAppDynamic

Import the AppModule (remove the import from main.ts) and bootstrap it using this platformWorkerAppDynamic platform.
